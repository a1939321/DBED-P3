Question:
Suppose that you are given source code for a DBMS that does not support indexing. This code was extensively tested, so we have a high degree of confidence that it works correctly. Now you were asked to extend the code, such that the indexing is supported. How would you test your extended code to make sure it works properly with indexing? Note that you don't need to provide any additional code for this question, just the answer.

Answer:
... your answer here ...
To test my extended code to ensure it work with the DBMS, I have tested a combination of
functional, performance and error testing.

Funtional testing:
I ran queries on id column (e.g select * from students where id='id number';)
and created an index on column id. I ran that queries again to ensure that it still
return the same result as before. I also tried create multiple indexes and run the same query
to check whether the results remained identical.

Error testing:
I tried to create index on the same columns tiwce,drop index on the columns that did not have one and
create index on a non-exist column.
This was done to ensure the DBMS continued to function correctly and produced appropriate error messages

Performance testing:
while doing all those test above I pay attendtion to time elapse of the queries and compare the different
when with and without index to confirm the usefullness of indexing feature.
